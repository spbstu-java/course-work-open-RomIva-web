Every morning, I wake up and the first thing I do is look at my phone. I read the news and check my email. As a student from Russia living in Germany, I must learn German, which I find quite difficult. My teacher is very good and tries to teach me something new every day.

After my lessons, I often meet a friend. Yesterday, we decided to eat some food at a small restaurant. I wanted to drink some water, but my friend ordered a big cup of hot tea. The waiter was very kind. I said "thank you" and he replied "please" with a smile. We talked about our families and our plans for the week. I look forward to the weekend because we will go to the cinema.

In the evening, I come back to my home. It is a small but comfortable house. I sit down at my computer and write in my book â€“ well, it's a digital diary on my laptop. I need to finish my homework, but sometimes I get tired and just want to listen to music or read a book. I understand that learning a language takes time, but I will not give up. Maybe one year from now, it will feel easy. I said "goodbye" to my old life, and now I am ready for this new challenge.
